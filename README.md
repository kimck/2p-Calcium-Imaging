# Background
GUI for implementing the previously published ICA/PCA method from Mukamel et al., Automated analysis of cellular signals from large-scale calcium imaging data. Neuron (2009). Behavioral inputs (e.g. licking, lever press, reward delivery) are recorded in a Ni-Daq as TTL inputs.


# Software requirements
MATLAB
CellSort (https://github.com/mukamel-lab/CellSort)
Shaded Errorbar (script included here) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-raacampbell-shadederrorbar)
